# DURATION : 8 WEEKS
# MENTOR : NEELA SANTOSH

## Task 4 involves creating a recommendation system using Java and machine learning libraries such as Apache Mahout. The goal is to build an intelligent system that can suggest products or content based on user preferences, mimicking the functionality used by platforms like Amazon, Netflix, or YouTube.

In this task, interns are expected to:

Understand and implement the collaborative filtering algorithm, which forms the basis for most recommendation engines.

Use Apache Mahout or similar libraries to process datasets and generate recommendations.

Create a sample dataset (or use a publicly available one) containing user-item interactions such as ratings, views, or purchases.

The deliverable is a Java program that reads user data, processes it using a recommendation algorithm, and outputs personalized suggestions. The application should demonstrate:

Efficient data handling and processing.

Integration of Mahout or a similar machine learning tool with Java.

Clear output showing relevant recommendations based on the input dataset.

Interns will gain valuable exposure to:

The fundamentals of machine learning and data-driven decision-making.

Real-world applications of artificial intelligence in user personalization.

Working with external libraries and managing dependencies in Java projects.

The program should be modular and well-documented, with commented code and usage instructions. All code and datasets should be stored in a GitHub repository, making it easy for reviewers to test and evaluate the system.

Online tools such as YouTube tutorials, Google, and ChatGPT can be used to understand recommendation systems and how to implement them using Java.

Successfully completing this task demonstrates proficiency in combining Java programming with AI concepts, marking a strong conclusion to the internship journey and contributing toward earning the completion certificate.
